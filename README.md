# kdaWebsite

This is a website I created in pure HTML/CSS. This is mainly a project I worked on to polish my website-building skills and to aid me in future projects. 
I used some Latin text and a fake ID along with pictures from the 'KDA' Kpop group to design my website. 
Although there are buttons for the About and the Blog page, they both don't do anything.
